INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama11b API : **Encoders in the Image**

In the provided image, the **encoders** are identified as:

*   **Encoding Categorical Data**: This encoder is responsible for transforming categorical data into a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

These encoders play a crucial role in the data preparation process, enabling the analysis and interpretation of categorical data within the context of machine learning.
INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama90b API : The image shows that "Encoding Categorical Data" is what the encoders are. It's part of a traditional machine learning workflow under "Balancing the Dataset".
